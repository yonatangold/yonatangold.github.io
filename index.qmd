Hi! I'm Yonatan Goldshtein. I am currently an assistant professor of Scandinavian Studies at Aalborg University. Starting July 2024 I will join the [DFF](https://dff.dk/) project "Attitudes and Understanding in Dialect Levelling - AUDiaL" led by [Nicolai Pharao](https://lanchart.hum.ku.dk/staff_scan/?pure=en/persons/164799){target="_blank} as a postdoctoral researcher at University of Copenhagen. In this project, we investigate the role of the individual language users' attitudes to language and place (among other things) in language change.

I identify as a scholar of language variation. By accident, I have also become a theoretical phonologist with a burning passion for everything that happens at the morphology-phonology interface. I am interested in exploring language variation on all scales, from large-scale quantitative studies of grammatical or attitudinal variation to the local negotiations of linguistic meaning between interlocutors in interaction. My interest in theoretical phonology has centered on the prosodic phenomenon "st√∏d" in Danish as well as the historically related word accents found in neighboring North Germanic languages.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:yonatanug@ikl.aau.dk) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
